# Dotfiles
My Dotfiles, currently neovim and awesome window manager configs. 

# Installation
1. Clone the repository to a folder somewhere on your system
2. Symlink the files (ln -s [DIR1/FILE1] [DIR2/FILE2]) to the appropriate location (probably somewhere in ~/.config)

# Notes:
Neovim is weird so you probably have to manually source and then packerinstall to get the theme and any other plugins I add.
